    "GRU model showed a strong start but it was unable to improve beyond the initial epoch and demonstrated signs of underfitting, making it less ideal for capturing complex temporal patterns in the data. While the LSTM model, achieved better overall performance, reaching a lower minimum validation loss (0.0019). However, it did show signs of overfitting in later epochs. LSTM is the better performing model in terms of predicting inflation_rate with this dataset."
